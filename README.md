## Deployment Optimization

This project has been optimized for deployment by moving large media assets to a CDN/object storage service. Follow these steps to manage assets:

### Setting Up DigitalOcean Spaces (or similar object storage)

1. Create a DigitalOcean Spaces bucket (or similar object storage)
2. Update the `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   SPACES_ENDPOINT=nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
   SPACES_REGION=us-east-1
   SPACES_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
   SPACES_KEY=your-spaces-access-key
   SPACES_SECRET=your-spaces-secret-key
   ```

### Uploading Assets to Object Storage

Run the following command to upload large assets to your object storage:

```
npm run upload-assets
```

This will:
- Scan the `assets` directory for files larger than 1MB
- Upload them to your object storage
- Create an `asset-mapping.json` file with the mapping between local paths and CDN URLs

### Updating Asset References

After uploading assets, run:

```
npm run update-references
```

This will:
- Update references in HTML, CSS, and JS files to point to the CDN URLs
- Update `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` to exclude large assets from version control and Docker builds

### Cleaning Up Local Assets (Optional)

If you want to free up disk space after uploading assets to the CDN, you can run:

```
npm run cleanup-assets
```

This will:
- Delete the original large files from your local system
- Create small placeholder files with information about the CDN location
- Show how much disk space was freed

### Deployment

The application is configured to deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform. With the large assets moved to object storage, the deployment should now succeed.

## Local Development

For local development, you can still keep the assets locally. The scripts will not delete any local files, only update the references in the code.
